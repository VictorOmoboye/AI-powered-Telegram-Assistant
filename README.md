# Victor Assistant 🤖

An AI-powered Telegram Agent built with **N8n** for intelligent real-time interaction, reasoning, image analysis, and web insights.

---

## Problem Statement
Most personal assistants are limited in scope—they either provide simple chat responses, lack memory of past interactions, or cannot analyze real-time information like news, weather, or images. This makes them less effective for users who need a **smarter, context-aware, and multi-capable assistant**.

---

## Solution
**Victor Assistant** is a **Telegram AI Agent** designed to overcome these limitations by integrating multiple advanced tools into a single workflow via **N8n**:

- **Telegram API** – Enables seamless chat interactions.  
- **OpenAI GPT-5** – Provides advanced reasoning and natural language responses.  
- **OpenAI GPT-4.0 (Vision)** – Analyzes images shared in real-time.  
- **Memory Module** – Stores conversation history, enabling context retention across chats.  
- **Tavily API** – Fetches real-time news, AI trends, and current weather updates.  

With this setup, Victor Assistant can:  
→ Chat naturally and remember past interactions.  
→ Analyze and describe images in real-time.  
→ Provide the latest AI trends and insights.  
→ Deliver real-time news and weather updates (time-zone aware).
